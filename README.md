Fortunately, the bank who behind this app has capital that only made from binaries cause I'm so broke :joy:. But it has users, five imaginary person. 

One of them is **Fae Merrill**. You can log in as her. Her  username is **fae**, (what a creative one) and her password is ***1234*** (probably you couldn't guess). 

So explore this great app send money to people, request loan from this mighty bank and enjoy.
